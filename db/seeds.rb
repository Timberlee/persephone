Clean fruits and veggies in a pan filled with water rather than running water from tap. Store drinking water in the fridge, do not let the tap run while you are waiting for water to cool. Do not use water to thaw meat or food, defrost food overnight in the fridge or use defrost setting on your microwave. Only do full loads of laundry or wash laundry by hand.', during: 'Outdoor Water Conservation Tips: Visit only commercial car washes that recycles water. Use a shut off nozzle that can be adjusted down to a fine spray on your hose if washing your own car. Avoid over watering your lawn and water only when needed. If your lawn does require watering, do so early in the morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler. Remember that a heavy rain elminates the need for watering up to two weeks. Lawns only need one inch of water per week most of the year. Check soil moisture levels with a soil probe, spade or large screwdriver. Dont water if soil is still moist, if your grass springs back when you step on it, do not water it. Stay on top of your sprinkler system and adjust sprinklers so only your lawn is watered, and not the house sidewalk or street. Avoid leaving sprinklers or hoses unattended. A garden hose can pour out 600 gallons or more in only a few hours. Water in several short sessions rather than one long one, in order for your lawn to better absorb moisture and avoid runoff. Use a broom or blower instead of a hose to clean leaves and other debris from your driveway or sidewalk.

Plan how to communicate with family members if you lose power. For example, you can call, text, email or use social media. Remember that during disasters, sending text messages is usually reliable and faster than making phone calls because phone lines are often overloaded. Keep your car in good working condition, and keep the gas tank full; stock your vehicle with emergency supplies and a change of clothes. If you have NFIP flood insurance, your policy may cover up to $1000 in loss avoidance measures, like sandbags and water pumps, to protect your insured property.

Get a ground assessment for your property and become familiar with the land around you. Learn whether debris flows have occuried in your area by contacting local officials. You may protect your property by planting ground cover on slopes and building retaining walls. In mudflow areas, build channels or deflection walls to direct the flow around buildings be aware however that if you divert debris flow onto your neighbors land you may be liable for damages. Changes occur in your landscape such as patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes (especially the places where runoff water converges) land movement, small slides, flows, or progressively leaning trees.
Look out for the following warning signs: Doors or windows stick or jam for the first time. New cracks that have appeared in plaster tile or brick foundations. Outside walls walks or stairs begin to pull away from the building. Slowly developing windening cracks appear on the ground or on paved areas such as streets or driveways. Broken underground utility lines which result in water breaking through the ground surface in new locations. A faint rubling sound that increases in volume is noticableas the landslide nears.

If you are near a stream or channel be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy.

Stay away from the slide area, more may be coming. Listen to local news and emergency stations for many days after. Watch for flooding which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event. Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area yourself. You can then help more by directing rescuers to these locations.
