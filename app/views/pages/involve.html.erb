*East Coast

- Sea levels have risen 8 inches globally since reliable recordkeeping started in 1880. Across the northeast, the sea level has risen 10-13 inches. This rise has made the odds of coastal flooding in New York similar to that of Hurricane Sandy <strong>20 times greater</strong>, and helped Sandy overtop barriers. Projections show that sea levels could rise by an <em>additional 48 inches</em> - that's four feet - by the year 2100.
- 50 million people live or work in the metropolitan areas of the northeast, which are already subject to the urban heat island effect - where heat builds up and can result in temperatures 10 degrees Farenheit hotter than in surrounding areas. With increased temperatures, residents from Washington D.C. and Philadelphia could see the number of days in a year over 95 degrees Farenheit <b>double</b> by 2050.
- In short: heat waves, heavy downpours, and rising sea levels all pose threats to infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, and ecosystems.
- The southeast experiences hurricanes on a yearly basis. Both the strength and frequency of category 4 and 5 (the most powerful) hurricanes have increased since 1980.
- Sea levels are also rising faster than the global average in the southeast, with a potential 6 inches of rise by 2030.
- In sum: extreme heat and sea level rises threaten health, energy, agriculture, and more.

*Country wide
- Across the country, a warmer climate leads to warmer winters. This harms us twofold: it helps many harmful pests and hurts helpful insects. It allows harmful pests to start reproducing earlier in the spring as well as extend their range northward. This hurts crop yields and increases the costs of pesticides. Likewise, it hurts honeybees who expend more energy during the winter when they should be resting for the pollinating season in the spring.

*Midwest and Great Plains Global Warming

-Increased heatwaves in the nation's heartland over the last six decades on average, with significant and growing implications for public health.

- Dangerous Storms & Flooding - heavy rains more common throughout the year, including risk of flood
- Winters and springs will be 25% wetter, increasing the pre existing high flood risk.
- Two heatwaves per summer, the standard summer will be hotter than the hottest year on record
- Air quality deteriorates as hotter weather causes more sever smog problems. Greater risk for asthma and other respiratory conditions.

Agricultural Threats

- Crops and livestock face substantially more heat stress, decreasing crop yield and livestock productivity
- Warmer winters and a growing season up to six weeks longer would enable pests like the corn earworm to expand their range.
- Crop production would be inhibited by changing rain patterns such as wetter springs(which delay planting and increase flood risk) and almost 15 percent less rain during the increasingly hot summers.

*West Coast
BEACH EROSION

*More severe droughts and reduced winter snowpack

Growing risk of "mega droughts" - also a risk to the midwest

Less snowmelt exacerbates water scarcity - effects agriculture ecosystems and urban areas

More extreme / wet weather

*Increased pressure on groundwater supplies -

demand is rising naturally but also b/c of climate change

aquifers on the decline for decades now

*Longer & more damaging wildfire seasons

Increase costs to fight fires

Forests are hotter and drier due to high temperatures and a lack of snowmelt

This is the perfect condition for fires to spred

ALL of the tip five largest fires in CA since 1932 have happened since 2000

*Widespread effects on the Pacific northwest

Impacting the warming of sensitive ecosystems of the region. Shellfish hatcheries failing
because of acidifying oceans, less snowmelt jeopardizing freshwater species like salmon and trout

*Extensive forest death in the rocky mountains

10s of millions of trees have died in the Rocky Mountains over the past 15 years over an area
as large as Colorodo. 129 million trees in california have faced a similar fate in this time period

*Costly and growing health impacts

More heat waves, worsening air, and water quality, increase in infections disease. Increasing duration of heat waves in the west, which brings a greater risk of death from dehydration, heat stroke, heart attack, and other heart related illnesses, particularly for less affluent neighborhoods that may not have as many trees for shande or access to air conditioning.

Will cause an increase in allergens which exacerbate lung diseases such as asthma and can cause breathing difficulties even in healthy people

*Coastal Impacts

Increasing sea levels, which leads to tidal flooding, shoeline erosion, saltwater intrusion, larger strom surges, and permanent inundation. Oncea acidification also threatens significant marine species such as oysters and Pacific salmon
