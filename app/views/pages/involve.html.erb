*Midwest Global Warming

-Increased heatwaves in the nation's heartland over the last six decades on average, with significant and growing implications for public health.

- Dangerous Storms & Flooding - heavy rains more common throughout the year, including risk of flood
- Winters and springs will be 25% wetter, increasing the pre existing high flood risk.
- Two heatwaves per summer, the standard summer will be hotter than the hottest year on record
- Air quality deteriorates as hotter weather causes more sever smog problems. Greater risk for asthma and other respiratory conditions.

Agricultural Threats

- Crops and livestock face substantially more heat stress, decreasing crop yield and livestock productivity
- Warmer winters and a growing season up to six weeks longer would enable pests like the corn earworm to expand their range.
- Crop production would be inhibited by changing rain patterns such as wetter springs(which delay planting and increase flood risk) and almost 15 percent less rain during the increasingly hot summers.

*More severe droughts and reduced winter snowpack

Growing risk of "mega droughts" - also a risk to the midwest

Less snowmelt exacerbates water scarcity - effects agriculture ecosystems and urban areas

More extreme / wet weather

*Increased pressure on groundwater supplies -

demand is rising naturally but also b/c of climate change

aquifers on the decline for decades now

*Longer & more damaging wildfire seasons

Increase costs to fight fires

Forests are hotter and drier due to high temperatures and a lack of snowmelt

This is the perfect condition for fires to spred

ALL of the tip five largest fires in CA since 1932 have happened sinec 2000

*Widespread effects on the Pacific northwest

Impacting the warming of sensitive ecosystems of the region. Shellfish hatcheries failing
because of acidifying oceans, less snowmelt jeopardizing freshwater species like salmon and trout

*Extensive forest death in the rocky mountains

10s of millions of trees have died in the Rocky Mountains over the past 15 years over an area
as large as Colorodo. 129 million trees in california have faced a similar fate in this time period

*Costly and growing health impacts

More heat waves, worsening air, and water quality, increase in infections disease. Increasing duration of heat waves in the west, which brings a greater risk of death from dehydration, heat stroke, heart attack, and other heart related illnesses, particularly for less affluent neighborhoods that may not have as many trees for shande or access to air conditioning.

Will cause an increase in allergens which exacerbate lung diseases such as asthma and can cause breathing difficulties even in healthy people

*Coastal Impacts

Increasing sea levels, which leads to tidal flooding, shoeline erosion, saltwater intrusion, larger strom surges, and permanent inundation. Oncea acidification also threatens significant marine species such as oysters and Pacific salmon
